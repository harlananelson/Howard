# Receiving the Inheritance – Joshua 13-19

Chapter 13 opens with the Lord telling Joshua, in his old age, that “there are still very large areas of land to be taken over” (13:1). The Israelites were faced with some people whom they simply could not dislodge from their midst and had to live with. Even when the Israelites became strong enough to dislodge them, they chose to subject them to slavery rather than drive them out.

Joshua’s old age is presented as the trigger for the command to divide the land for an inheritance now. Although “there remains yet very much land to possess” (v.1), the allocation and distribution of it among the tribes must be conducted by Joshua, under God, while he is still alive and active.

The reason for the many details recorded in these chapters is to remind ourselves that it is all primarily a witness to the faithfulness of God, who had promised this to His people many centuries before.

Caleb steps forward to claim a promise that had been made and now must be fulfilled. A refrain that occurs three times in Joshua best describes Caleb: he “wholeheartedly followed the Lord” (14:8, 9, 14).

### Notice these spiritual strengths in Caleb’s character:
- He believed that God’s word is dependable despite the passage of time. God keeps His promises.
- He did not follow the crowd but followed his personal convictions.
- He was not ready to settle for less than what God had promised.

The tribes of Joseph complain that they cannot be expected to fight against people with iron chariots (17:14-18). Contrast their attitude with that of eighty-five-year-old Caleb who is ready to battle a strong people (14:12). Joshua displays leadership and patience as he encourages these tribes to have courage and do what God expects of them. If there were so many, why could they not use their numerical strength to conquer more land for themselves?

Seven tribes had not yet received their inheritance (18:1-10). The seven tribes were concerned about whether there would be a fair distribution of the land. Not all the land was of equal size or value, so they wondered which tribes would get the best and which the worst areas. Because they did not know what to do, they did nothing at all! Joshua’s solution of casting lots assured them that the final decisions would be impartial. The lot was cast in the presence of the Lord (19:51).

## Reflection:
Does your response to God’s promises more closely resemble those of:
- **Caleb**: wholehearted faith and obedience?
- **The people of Joseph**: complaints, lack of faith?
- **The seven tribes**: procrastination?

If you know that something to be prized is within your grasp and that it will be yours when it is secured, the motivation to press on and make it your own is huge. A parallel to our Christian experience is found in Philippians 3:12:  
*“I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.”*

To believe that the blessings of the gospel are ours now in measure and will be increasingly ours – that will change our perspective on how we live our lives.
